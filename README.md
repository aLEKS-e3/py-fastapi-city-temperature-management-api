# Introduction

This FastAPI project offers a straightforward and effective way to handle city data and their temperature records. Whether you're retrieving, adding, updating, or deleting city entries and their temperature data, this user-friendly API makes it a breeze.

## Features
- **Ease of Use**: Enjoy a simple and intuitive interface for managing city and temperature data.
- **Full Control**: Perform a variety of operations, including retrieval, addition, updating, and deletion of city entries and temperature records.
- **Validation**: FastAPI assures that input data is carefully validated to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **API Documentation**: Access comprehensive API documentation for seamless integration and usage.

### Bonus
- **Asynchronous Requests for External API Updates**: In this Temperature management API, a powerful feature was implemented that allows for asynchronous requests to an external API when updating temperature data for all cities. This feature ensures efficient and speedy retrieval of current temperature information, enhancing the overall performance and responsiveness of our application.


## Description
Our project consists of two main applications:

1. __City CRUD API__

The City CRUD API enables users to perform basic CRUD operations on city data. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete city entries. This API was designed to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring seamless management of city information.

2. __Temperature API__

The Temperature API is responsible for managing temperature records associated with cities. It provides endpoints to fetch temperature data for specific cities and update temperature records. This API was implemented to fetch current temperature data from external sources and store it efficiently in our database.

## Design Choices

### FastAPI

FastAPI was chosen for its high performance, asynchronous capabilities, and automatic API documentation generation. FastAPI allows to build scalable and efficient web applications with minimal effort.

### SQLAlchemy

For database management, SQLAlchemy was opted due to its powerful ORM capabilities and support for multiple database backends. Using SQLAlchemy simplifies database interactions and ensures data integrity and consistency.

### Alembic

Alembic is used for database migrations in this project. It provides a robust framework for managing database schema changes over time. With Alembic, it's possible to easily version-control the database schema and apply migrations as needed, ensuring smooth and reliable database upgrades across different environments.

### Pydantic

Pydantic is used for data validation and serialization. By defining Pydantic models for our data structures, we ensure that input data is validated before processing, reducing the risk of errors and improving overall reliability.

## Installation

1. Clone the project on your local machine
